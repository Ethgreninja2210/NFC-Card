# NFC-Card

 I have ceated a fun little project that shouldn't be too expensive from PCB manufactures. I decided This project would be cool to learn about NFC tags and PCB design. I also want to make this into a card I could use as an ID card or perhaps adjust this at a later date into a different form to use in something like a D&D game or a scavenger hunt.
